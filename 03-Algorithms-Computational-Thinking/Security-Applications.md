### Topic: [Algorithms - General]
*   **My Current Understanding:**  
    "Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or completing a task. In computing, they tell a computer exactly what to do. Efficiency matters—some ways of solving a problem are much faster than others."
*   **My Security Question:**  
    "If security is a 'problem' (like 'detect an intruder' or 'break an encryption'), then are there specific algorithms for solving these security problems? How does the speed of an algorithm affect an attack (like password cracking)?"
*   **What I Hope to Learn:**  
    "I want to understand the types of algorithms and how their efficiency is measured. I suspect this will help me understand both how security tools work and how attackers optimize their methods."
